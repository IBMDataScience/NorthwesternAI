This folder contains the Fashion MNIST datasets for the deep learning tutorials. 


## The Data
We're going to use the Fashion MNIST Data from Zolando Research. 
More info about this data [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master/data). You can also [download with Keras](https://keras.io/datasets/#fashion-mnist-database-of-fashion-articles).

Watson Studio [Documentation for Deep Learning and Cloud Object Storage](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_object_store.html?audience=wdp&context=analytics). 

```

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. 
It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

In [Original Data](./original_data), there is the `ubyte.gz` data in the same format as MNIST. 

In the [NNM](./NeuralNetworkModeler) peice, there is a file [data.zip](./NeuralNetworkModeler/data.zip) which contains the same data in `python pickle` format.
